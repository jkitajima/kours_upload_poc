# Upload Service

This repository was created with the purpose of conducting a proof of concept (PoC) for an upload service using Go as the base language and without the dependency of large frameworks. Additionally, the project structure should be flexible enough to accommodate the progression of business logic and also serve as a foundation for other HTTP services. Lastly, it should demonstrate how to achieve better performance in file uploads by structuring the code in a concurrent manner (by dividing the upload of data and metadata into different storages).

> [!NOTE]
> The project structure was approved and this template served as the foundation for a complete upload service for the platform in question. The final repository code is located in a closed repository within the Kours platform organization.<br /><br />
